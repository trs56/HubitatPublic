## Welcome to my Hubitat Repository!
This is where I will be posting code for my drivers and apps. It is late December 2023 and I am just starting out with HE and Groovy, after 10 years on Vera. But it took me a year after buying buying my HE device to finally make the switch because there was one thing I was doing in Vera that I just knew was going to be a problem. Sure enough it was, but not one that couldn't be solved, and thus was born my first HE device driver. My migration is complete. I'm really glad I finally made the switch.

All of the code I post out here will include a User Guide to go with it, here in my public Hubitat repository.

Thanks for checking this out and good luck with my drivers! Hope you find them useful. First up... and possibly the only...

### Hikvision Actuator for Input Alarms and Motion Detection
The driver gives you ability to trigger Alarm Input events and enable/disable motion detection features. Please see the User Guide for additional information.
