## Introduction
This device driver implements the HE Actuator capability. It allows you to trigger Alarm Input Events and enable/disable Motion Detection and PIR Sensors on your Hikvision cameras by running its custom commands from your rules and apps.
 
The key feature of this driver is the ability to use HE Rules to trigger Alarm Input Events, but to use it, your camera must have wired Alarm I/O ports that are accessible and not in use. Since the first thing you will need to do is find a short piece of thin wire and connect the two positive(+) ports. This is required since the driver is only allowed to trigger Alarm Out when using the Hikvision CGI. The CGI does not not allow apps to trigger Alarm In. The only way is to put voltage on the wire, which is all triggering Alarm Out does.

So when you call the command to set Alarm On from your rules, the driver will trigger Alarm Out and the voltage will flow. The Alarm Input Event on your camera will then fire, provided it is enabled and armed.  You can and should test this yourself by connecting the ports and triggering a manual alarm from the camera.
 
This allows you to trigger alarms on your cameras whenever conditions warrant and use HE to control the arming schedule for Motion Detection and PIR sensors.

This release will report on the enabled/disabled state of Line Crossing and Intrusion Events, but does not allow you to change them. Nor does it allow you to change the enabled/disabled state of the Alarm Input Event. You control that and its arming schedule on the camera. These features are planned for a future release.
 
## Camera Configuration
To use the driver, your camera must be configured as follows:
Please note that the path to the setting on your camera may be different.
 
1: System > Security > Web Authentication = digest/basic
 
2: Network > Advanced > Integration Protocol >
   Hikvision-CGI Enabled, Authentication=digest/basic
 
3: Optional Operator account with the Remote Parameters/Settings and Remote Notify options selected.   
You can use your admin account, but it is recommended that you create an Operator account for Hubitat.
 
4: Basic and Smart Events must not be configured to trigger Alarm Out.   
Check Linkage Methods for all Basic and Smart Events to make sure this option is not selected. HE is now in control.   
 
5: Enable Alarm Input Handling in Basic Events - Alarm Input   
Set Alarm Type to NO (is default, normally open, no voltage)   
Set the Alarm Name (e.g. CamName Alarm)   
Set the Arming Schedule to 24x7 for now. You decide later.   
Set desired Linkage Methods (email, notify, record)   
    
6: Connect the Alarm In/Out ports with a small jumper wire.   

7: Your camera must be configured with a static ip address, or a reserved address on your router if using DHCP.
 
You are now ready to configure your camera for operation with HE using the Hikvision Actuator.
 
## Device Configuration and Operation
1: Add a new Virtual Device using the Hikvision Actuator

2: Enter your camera ip address, port and credentials in userid:password format. Click Save.
 
Whenever you Save Preferences, the driver will validate your camera by first pinging the ip address and then sending a GET request for the data from /System/deviceInfo using the Credentials you entered. When these checks fail, an error message will be displayed in the zStatus attribute and you will need fix it and try again. If you can't get past this step, you may need to call the help desk to report that you have a Hikvision camera that is not being recognized.
 
IF all is well, it will say Yay!. Your camera has been validated and is ready for operation.
 
If the a motion detection feature is not available on your camera, (i.e the URL Path was not found), its status will be set to NA and the on/off commands for that feature will be disabled.
 
You may now start running commands and create test rules to validate its operation. You should do this before you deploy into your home security setup and the arming of your house for security purposes.

Start with turning your motion sensors on/off and watch the change in state. Confirm the change in state on your camera.

Turn the Alarm On to confirm you receive the notifications you have configured for the Alarm Input Event. If you have a camera with a siren, check that option under Linkage Methods to see how fast the trigger is.

DO NOT forget to turn the Alarm OFF in your rules when conditions warrant or go back to normal. So if you have a rule with (conditions=true) that turns it on, you need a second rule with (conditions=false) to turn it off.

This driver now gives you the flexibility to trigger your cameras with more reliable and consistent PIR sensors, or any other sensor. For example, when you're away and your house is armed, you can trigger all of your cameras if any one of your security sensors goes off.

You are now in complete control of when Alarms can be triggerd on your cameras and when Motion Detection features are enabled. Once you're up and running and have validated its operation, this driver will run quietly in the background, so you can rest assured it will perform the actions you need it to when called upon.
 
## State Changes During Operation
The status attributes change when a command is run that triggers it. The driver always gets the current state from the camera first, to determine if a change in state is actually needed, and then updates the status attribute to the new state, as needed, using sendEvent.

During normal operation, zStatus should remain OK at all times. All commands ping the ip first to see if it is online. If the ping fails, zStatus will go to OFF and remain OFF until a command is run that sees it back online.
 
If you change the credentials of the hubitat account on the camera and forget to change them here, the next time a command is run, zStatus will be set to CRED and operation suspended until you Save Preferences to fix the mis-match.
 
If any unexpected HTTP GET/PUT errors occur, zStatus will go to ERR and operation suspended until the problem is resolved and Save Preferences is run. These errors may require a call to the help desk.
## Errors and Troubleshooting
The driver logs all of its activity and catches all errors from the http get/put methods but does not catch Groovy/Java script errors involving bad data.
 
So if it stops working, check the logs. The code is making certain assumptions about the data it is receiving and processing. If anything changes in that stream, bad things don't happen, nothing does. And that's a problem when it comes to home security.
 
Debug logging is used for dumping the converted XML data that is returned by the camera in response to a GET request. With this release, the driver is relying on the translation of the XML data returned by the camera into a GPath object in Groovy, which is quirky and presents challenges in determining how to reference certain elements in the Gpath in order to obtain it's value.
 
Fortunately, the XML Schemas provided by the HIKVision CGI won't change, but there may be newer or older cameras out there that send back a slightly different XML response that could change the way Groovy interprets the structure, which could require a change to the way the code references the data element it needs.
## Security Warning
This driver uses HTTP Basic Authentication to login to your camera. Your encoded credentials are saved and displayed in the Data section of the device in the format required for this method of authentication.
